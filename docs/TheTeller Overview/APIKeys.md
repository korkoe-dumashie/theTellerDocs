# This section describes what API keys are and how to retrieve them.

Theteller authenticates your API requests using your account's API keys. If you do not include your key when making an API request, or use one that is incorrect or outdated, Theteller returns an error.

All API requests exist in either test or live mode, and one mode cannot be manipulated by data in the other. To get your test api keys you need to sign up [here](#).

## Obtaining your API keys

Your API keys are available in the Dashboard by navigating to **My Account**.

> **Warning:** Only use your test API keys for testing and development.

If you cannot see your API keys in the Dashboard, this means you do not have access to them, kindly contact your Theteller support.

# Test and live modes

The test and live modes function almost identically, with a few necessary differences:

- In test mode, payments are not processed by card networks or payment providers, and only our Test cards can be used
